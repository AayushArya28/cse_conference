            <p>IMS Ghaziabad is organizing an International Conference on “Marketing in the Digital World: Impact on the Indian Economy” on Saturday, December-07, 2019. The Digital revolution has immensely arrived and it touches every aspect of human life in relation to education, healthcare, financial transactions, financial management, corporate financing and investments, public procurement and distribution, collection of taxes by government, besides facilitating trade and international business. It has particularly emphasized upon the digitalization in the areas such as marketing, economics, international trade and business. Digitalization in India is growing at a very fast pace with exponential growth. Digital footprint in personal life is visible and it is impacting society, economy and environment. Digitalization has opened new window of opportunities for startup communities. According to Boston Consultancy Group; India has one of the largest and fastest growing populations of internet users in the world and it is expected that India will cross 500 million internet users in the year 2020. According to NASSCOM report, the number of startups crossed 4200 in the year 2015; interestingly majority of these start ups are focusing on e- commerce, m- commerce and digital advertising. Digitalization is working like a tidal wave and it is accountable for technological disruption. It has significantly impacted customer acquisition, retention and service strategy as communication has shifted from ‘one to one’ communication to ‘one to many’ and ‘many to many’ communication. Digitalization is also impacting international trade agreements and economic integrations. As digitalization is taking over traditional way of trade and commerce so it is essential for the entrepreneurs, researchers and policy makers to review the current economic, social and trade related business environment, keeping in mind the market dynamics and the volatility of the market.</p>
